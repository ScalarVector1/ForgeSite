### Hello!

this is some markdown text that I'm testing the viabliity of to use for card bodies. JSON is great but its really not great to write actual body text in and I'd like some formatting ability beyond forcing linebreaks.

## Is this a good idea?

I havent got a clue! This is already getting convoluted with how im writing profiles, but hey thats just the nature of software sometimes.
