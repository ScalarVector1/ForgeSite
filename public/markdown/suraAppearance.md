## At a glance
Sura is a shorter charr with striped gray fur, blue eyes, and white hair. Her horns extend backward in a long spiral shape. Those that look closely enough may notice faint burn scars under the fur on the left side of her face. Her expression typically rests in a nonchalant-looking slight smile, or a more neutral boredom depending on the situation. While her equipment and general hygiene seem decently well-maintained, her hair and fur are typically not, usually being a bit messy.

## Equipment and clothing
Sura's usual outfit usually consists of heavy plate armor with a dark blue finish on the outside, but it's not uncommon for her to switch out pieces or even the entire outfit for parts of various disguises she's used and made before. Common between all of her outfit choices, though, is her Ash Legion pack and a dark leather belt which holds her tome and axe.

## Other features
On the left side of her face, from the cheek to just around the eye, would be a large burn scar hidden underneath the fur that had grown over it. While difficult to see to the naked eye, those close enough might be able to make out the discoloration of the skin underneath. A similar marking would be present on the left side of her body, reaching from about two inches under the arm to her waist.
