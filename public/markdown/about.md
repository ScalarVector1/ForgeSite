## What is this site?
Just a small personal site I threw together for some of my RP characters in Guild Wars 2. Nothing fancy, just a silly little blog-style site with some visual effects. This is also probably a terrible example of how to do alot of things in all honesty, most of the character profiles are just read out of giant JSON files. If you want to do something with any of the code here go ahead, all the assets are attributed to ArenaNet for those pulled from GW2 and to the appropriate artists as applicable on the site. (I know this isn't legally sound, but I really dont think anyone is coming after my tiny website that generates no revenue and gets maybe 2 visitors a month.)
