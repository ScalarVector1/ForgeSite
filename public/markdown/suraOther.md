## Waypoint sickness
Sura is afflicted with a condition that she and her warband have coined 'waypoint sickness'. She experiences extreme nausea when dealing with any form of teleportation, akin to motion sickness. This is typically proportional to the distance traveled, but can also vary from trip to trip. Because of this she typically prefers to travel by foot or vehicle over paying large fees just to lose her lunch.
