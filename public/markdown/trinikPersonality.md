## Overview
Work hard, play hard -- a turn of phrase that Trink has come to live by, to a perhaps almost scary degree. Neither aspect does she take unseriously, be it from planning an elaborate attack to poision the food supply of an entire encampment, or to wave the imperator's knickers around on a stick in the barracks for all to see.

## Ideals and values
Trinik is at her core a military woman -- her mission and her men come first. What that mission is, however, is not always the barkings of a higher authority. In spite of recent events of official reconciliation of the flame legion with the high legions, Trinik retains a personal heavy skepticism against them -- one enough to draw blades against them.

## Habits and behaviors
Trinik is prone to excessive organization and grooming -- she will not leave a paper slanted or bottle open on her desk, or let her outfit become wrinkled or dirited beyond repair. One may also find her tapping at the desk with the point of her daggers, or twirling them by the tip. All in the same place, ofcourse, as not to create more than one notch in it.

Of note is her writing, which she takes care in as well -- writing out neat and even cursive at speeds one might only hope to scratch out chicken scratch. One with a keen eye for magic may notice a hint of shadow magic to her hands as she does so.

## Speech
Trin speaks clearly and with force, unlike the slightly slurred patterns of some other charr. Her voice is collected, lower and more eloquent than one might expect from a charr. Her words are calculated, or when forced to improvise, careful. 

## Likes and dislikes
Trin enjoys being around other who are highly motivated, intelligent in planning, and careful. She take great joy in both her work and pranks, and despite her intimidating nature suggesting otherwise takes pleasure in being interrupted while planning, provided it is for good reason.

She fears the ire of her superiors, and even moreso that of those she commands. Due to previous encounters with flame legion, she distrusts them greatly, especially at any sign of indecent intentions.
