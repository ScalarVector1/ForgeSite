## At a glance
Trinik is a large specimen -- even by charr standards. Her white fur is laden with deep black stripes, accompanied by her neat dyed-gray hair braided on her head and sleek curved horns. It would be incredibly rare to find her not incredibly well put together, hair and fur clean and sleek, the elonian fabrics washed and dried, and weapons perfectly allaigned to her sides. The gaze of her purple eyes could strike fear or joy into the heart of all but the most resolute, depending on if it is accompanied by a snarl or one of her genuine friendly looking smiles.

## Equipment and clothing
Trin's outfit comes from Elona, shamelessly. Custom made and fit to her large build are fine fabrics of deep gray and black, accompanied by sandshark-leather shoulderpads and gloves. The metal rings carefully woven into her braids fall silently against the soft fabric, as to allow her them without compromising her stealth. To each side of her, tucked with precision into her clothing, are swordbreaker daggers, polished and sharpened regularly. To her right a standard ash legion pistol is holstered, and upon her back a standard ash legion pack. Anyone who might manage to open her pack would find every dagger, vial, bullet, and piece of paper organized nearly perfectly, packed tight enough as to not come undone in the field.
