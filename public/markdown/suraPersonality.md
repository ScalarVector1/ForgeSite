## Overview
In general, Sura tends to approach social situations fairly openly, often laid-back or tending towards teases or harmless jokes. While she often doesn't have much of a filter and speaks ahead of consideration of her words, it's rare to find her acting with ill intent towards others without heavy provocation.

## Ideals and values
At present, Sura's core ideals revolve around protecting and helping those she considers her direct friends and family, relationships built on trust and friendship over code, and finding happiness and excitement in life through the means available to her. She largely dislikes fighting for the sake of a large, invisible organization and draws her power as a guardian from the purpose of protecting those she cares about more than a 'greater good' or 'the cause'.

## Habits and behaviors
Sura has a tendency to use her magic for what some might consider 'silly' purposes, such as creating guardian barriers to rest her shoulder on or flames to heat up food or start a stovetop. Due to her strong dislike of water and being wet, she will often use guardian fire magic to immolate herself to quickly dry off when needed or in place of traditional hygiene such as showering.

Physically, she tends to scratch her chin when in thought, or hook her right index claw around the hooked end of her axe when anxious (or, of course, when she believes she may need to draw it.)

## Speech 
Sura's speech pattern slips in and out of more 'civil' pronunciation and the more slurred pronunciation of legion charr. Her words themselves usually lean more blunt, or considerate yet honest than flowery or reserved. While her vocabulary typically isn't anything exotic, it would be hard to interpret her as uneducated.

Sura often has a tendency to slip or say more than she might intend to, leading to her often backpedaling or needing to apologize. While it's rare for her to let something truly offensive or aggressive slip, it's not uncommon for her to sometimes say too much.

## Likes and dislikes
Sura enjoys social interactions in general, armorsmithing work, and having the opportunity to help those she feels close to. She also has an affinity for greasy food such as fatty meats or fried/grilled sandwiches. Despite no longer wanting to fight directly for the legions, she still finds satisfaction in sabotage and destruction work.

Sura heavily dislikes water and the sensation of being wet, to the point she avoids it as much as possible. She also heavily dislikes any travel revolving around teleportation such as waypoints or asura gates due to her waypoint sickness. She also has a very particular distaste for the taste of sandshark meat due to subsisting off it alone in the crystal desert for a long duration during her time there.

Sura also has a vendetta against the Flame Legion due to her history in fighting against the group. Those that compare her to them due to her affinity for fire magic and arson often anger her greatly as well.
